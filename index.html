  Do more with SASS.
  Don't believe the hype.
  The best CSS framework from the internet.
  A CSS framework for grown ups.
  CSS Grid, CSS Vars, inverted, modular scale …  
  versatile, opportunistic + it works.
  Teutonic CSS is opportunistic with mini-components as well as some useful utilities. Powerful grid options, interface components and helpers. 
  Customize and extend even the min version with CSS vars.
  Copy/paste the HTML fragments you'll need. 
  A built process is optional, customize min.css with CSS Vars.
