description: >
  Helper class for text heavy pages to easily jump to deeplinks, aka hashlinks. A headline with an ID can have a visual anchor which adds a "Â¶" character. Linked targets are highlighted. It works for headlines and any other block elements. Just like on the pages here you can create a Table Of Contents navigation.

<div class="read_m">
  <div class="ma-b_s text_s">
    <a href="#anchor-headline" class="button text-clip pa_xs">&darr; Link to anchor headline</a>
    <a href="#anchor-block" class="button text-clip pa_xs">&darr; Link to anchor block</a>
  </div>

  <h3 id="anchor-headline">
    An anchored headline
    <a href="#anchor-headline" class="anchor"></a>
  </h3>
  <p id="anchor-block" class="ma-t_s">
    When hovering the headline above, you'll see a reverse <a href="http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/series/the-pilcrow/">Pilcrow</a> character that also links itself, so you can click and then share a deeplink.
