   Here is the scenario: You want your user to display something to copy/paste. I found readonly text inputs most usable for this, as you can asure that no white space characters are copied accidentally.

details: >
  The text-helper text-select-all should select the inputs contents by click/touch, but it only seems to work with Safari that way, so I have cheated a little JS in there. For longer multi-line values a textarea will work the same way. Here the long text string is cropped.
