description: >
  I don't know about you. But I think Wikipedia is a terrible reading experience on a desktop browser â€” the text lines are too long. Something between 45-75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length per line. The text-length helper classes are keeping this in an aesthetic balance. 


details: >
  The read-width class name is matching the text-size class name. Usually use `read_l` in combination with `.text_l`. Appearance can differ from typeface to typeface.
