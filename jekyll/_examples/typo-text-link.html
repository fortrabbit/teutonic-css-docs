description: >
  The `.link` class sets some default behaviour for links. It's like an optional reset. Most importantly, it uses the prime color instead of the browser default blue. It's optional, so you need to add the class, unless used in context, like in an [article](#article). Beside the `:hover` state, `:visited` will also be styled, so your users know where they have been already.
